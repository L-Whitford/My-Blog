Like the Mediterranean diet, veganism is just one of those things that almost everyone knows about, but very few people understand. As a nutrition and dietetics student, I cannot count the number of questions I’ve gotten about veganism. And I have to be honest with you-I really didn’t know a whole lot about veganism before researching this post.

Besides that vegans, ya know, don’t use animal products. Or eat animal products.

But research I did! And I came up with some really interesting facts about veganism that I want to share.

Before I get started though, just a quick little disclaimer: Veganism is not a “diet” in that people just go on it to lose weight, but I’m exploring it on this diet blog anyway because I think it’s super interesting. Veganism is actually a whole lifestyle and culture, but I’m just going to explore the food side for this post.

Anyhoo, enough rambling. Let’s get into some history…

Technically veganism is just an extreme form of vegetarianism, and didn’t officially become known as “veganism” until the term was coined in 1944. So in the grand scheme of things, being “vegan” is a fairly new concept (when you consider how old earth is and all), but the concept of vegetarianism has been around since about 500 BC! Yow!

Personally, I think “vegan” sounds much nicer than “extreme vegetarian”. But maybe that’s just me.

Veganism really began to take hold when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was founded in 1980. Once PETA started to get the word out that animals were suffering, many people started saying no to meat and yes to plants. Today lots of people eat vegan diets and live vegan lifestyles, including several YouTubers and lots of celebrities.

And contrary to popular belief, there are actually A LOT of things you can eat on a vegan diet, like:

Veggies galore: Broccoli, tomatoes, potatoes, squash. Seriously folks. There are way more veggies out there than you think.

Fruity fruits: I have actually seen vegans smash (as in eat) a whole watermelon. No joke.

Nuts and seeds and stuff: Like almonds, peanuts, peanut butter, and pretty much any nut you can think of. High in protein, high in yums.

Beanies and legumes: Good news: vegans can have hummus. What more do you need? Protein galore, plus a good lot of fiber.

Whole grains: I heard legend of a vegan who ate only whole wheat pasta. Would not recommend, but it’s nice to know it’s an option.

Vegans don’t eat meat, eggs, dairy, honey, or any product that was made by an animal. They also don’t wear leathers or use any products tested on animals, but that’s a different post.

So you may be asking yourself, what are the benefits of stuffing my face with veggies all day? Well, I’ll tell you…

Your heart will thank you: Studies have shown that plant-based diets may lower your risk of developing heart disease, PLUS vegans tend to pile on the healthy fats. Winning.

Can help you lose those lbs: As we all well know, calorie restriction sucks. Lucky for us, veganism offers an alternative. Veggies and fruits have lots of bulk and fiber for relatively low calorie counts, meaning most people end up eating less calories while still feeling full. Bring on the roasted veg!

Ditch your multivitamin: Thanks to all the fruits and veggies that vegans eat, the average person will get all the vitamins and minerals they need from this diet.

Whew, that was a lot. And friends, that was just scratching the surface of this diet. If you have any specific questions about this diet, leave them in the comments below and I’ll do the research for you! Or you could do what I do and head over to YouTube to hear about veganism from actual vegans.

Thanks for learning with me!
