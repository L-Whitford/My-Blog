Unless you’ve been living under a rock or a similarly wifi-less location, odds are you’ve heard of the Mediterranean diet. And, if you’re anything like me, you didn’t know much about the diet beyond eating fish. Lots of fish. But there is good news! You don’t have to only subsist on sea creatures to follow this diet. Stay tuned to see what I mean.

But first, how about a history lesson?

The Mediterranean Diet first showed up in, surprise, surprise, the the Mediterranean basin.

This diet is based on what people living in this geographical area would have eaten in the 1940s and 1950s, hence the focus on fish as a protein source. The Mediterranean diet was first publicized in 1975, but didn’t really catch on until the 1990s
The Mediterranean diet has been steadily gaining in popularity since then, especially in the last few years, and for good reason. This diet is full of plants, healthy fats, and really isn’t all that restrictive. Add to that the heart healthy benefits and we have ourselves a pretty good diet plan! But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Let’s talk about what you can eat on the Mediterranean diet:

All the veg: it should be of no surprise that a diet calls for more veggies. So bust out those green leafies!

Fruits on fruits on fruits: High in vitamins? Check. High in fiber? Check. High in yumminess? Check and Check.

Go Nuts for Seeds: Peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds (like this yum recipe), and sunflower seeds. Basically a snacker’s dream.

Beans, beans, musical fruit: Come on, you know the rest.

Tubers: Which is really just a funny sounding word for potatoes and squash and stuff

Whole grains: Fiber, yo! Sorry, white bread doesn’t count.

Get in your protein with: Fish, poultry, eggs, dairy

Bless the Lord, you can have fats! But healthy ones, like avocado, olive oil, olives, etc.

Gettin’ spicy: with garlic, basil, cinnamon, and the like.

Some of my steak lovers out there may notice a stark lack of beef in that list. Don’t worry, you can still have it, but keep it at a minimum.

So now you know everything you can (and can’t) eat on this diet, you may be wondering, why you should follow this diet? Well sit back and pop on your learning hats, friends, because we are about to talk about the wondrous benefits of the Mediterranean diet.

Heart healthy: Reducing the amount of refined foods and red meats in your diet can really help your heart in the long run! Add that to the healthy fats and omega-3s from the fish, and your heart will have plenty of reason to thank you.


Stay sharp: Research suggests that following the Mediterranean may help lower your risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, which means your mind can stay sharp well into your golden years.

Keep away Parkinson’s disease: The Mediterranean diet will have you eating tons of fruit and veg, meaning your antioxidant intake will 
be higher than ever! More antioxidants=Less oxidative stress=Lower risk of Parkinson’s.

Whether or not you like fish, I think we can all agree the health benefits of this diet look pretty great. But as with all diets, the main thing to consider is if the diet works with your lifestyle, and is something you want to maintain in the long run.

Thanks for coming along with me as I learned about the Mediterranean diet. See you next time!
