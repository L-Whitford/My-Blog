Seriously, who HASN’T heard of Oprah by this point? And if you know Oprah, you probably know that she is often revered for her diet habits. I mean, the woman has her own cookbook,

This is a talk show host people. With a cookbook. And diet tips that people listen to.

Honestly, it’s a dream of mine to one day have a cookbook. Now all I need is everything Oprah has! Affluence, an audience, money… Piece of cake?

But back to the real reason you’re here: Oprah Winfrey’s diet. Before jumping in to a look at what this awesome lady eats in a day, how about a little look into the past?

I had a little bit of trouble pinning down exactly when the world started paying attention to Ms. Winfrey’s diet, so I went straight to the source: O Magazine. According to Oprah, she’s had some pretty rickety dieting plans in the past (I’m paraphrasing of course). 

Basically, America became intrigued by Oprah’s eating habits in 1988 when she lost a bunch of weight on a liquid diet.
As you all hopefully know by now, any sort of weight loss obtained by such drastic means doesn’t tend to last, and Oprah was no exception. To quote the great lady herself, “I got down to 145 pounds—and stayed there for one day before the regaining began. ”
Yikes!
After regaining all that weight and more, Oprah (and her doctor) decided a change needed to happen. So she started to eat better. She started exercising. She focused on bettering her health rather than losing weight.
Guess what happened then?
She. Got. Healthier.
And, like, thinner too, but mainly the healthy thing.
THAT, folks, is why so many people trust Oprah for diet advice. Because they saw that what she did worked for her. And you gotta hand it to her. The woman looks fantastic. But exactly how does she maintain such glowing health?

I’m glad you asked…

It’s time for the good stuff, friends. Here is a rundown of what Oprah eats on the regular.

*Based on this 24-hour recall of her diet*

A protein and fiber packed b-fast: Yes, even ultra busy Oprah has time for breakfast. So you really have no excuse. According to the article, her “usual” is egg, tomato, and avocado on whole wheat toast. Healthy fats? Check. Fiber? Check. Yummy? Do I even need to write “Check” here?

A meticulously measured lunch: Y’all, there were specific ounces listed. Most people don’t measure out their food, least of all in ounces and cups. And hey, hey, good news! Her meal was pasta with shrimp and cheese. PASTA. CHEESE. SHRIMP. So good.

A fruity little snack: Fresh sorbet with berries and mint. Yums.

A veg-tastic dinnner: Fish, rice, veggies. The basic “healthy meal” for a reason.

Bedtime munchies: Popcorn+kale chips= a crunchy dream.

To sum it up, Oprah eats a balanced diet that includes fruits, veggies, grains, lean proteins, and a wee bit of dairy. Her diet is pretty in line with the MyPlate if you ask me.

Oh, and I should also mention that while Oprah does follow a Weight Watcher’s diet plan, you certainly don’t have to if you’re looking to match her eating habits.

And why should you match her eating habits? I’m glad you asked. Here are a few things off the top of my head that are good about Oprah’s diet.

Fiber: Since there are a lot of fruits and veggies and whole grains included in her diet, Oprah’s fiber intake is pretty darn close to meeting the daily requirements it doesn’t meet it already. Besides fiber being good for keeping you, you know, regular, soluble fibers that are found in a lot of fruits actually can help you maintain good blood sugars. They slow down digestion to keep those sugars steady.

Fats, but the good kind: I counted a couple of healthy fats in Oprah’s diet, which we know is good for heart health. Fats also happen to be very good for flavor, so it’s nice to eat healthy ones when you can.

So Oprah probably doesn’t take multivitamins because her diet already has tons of vitamins and minerals from all the fruit and veg she’s eating! Which, by the by, is the way eating is supposed to work. Sorry vitamin companies.

Whew, this was a long post. But can you blame me? I’m always fascinated to read about what those darn celebs are eating nowadays, and it’s really refreshing to read a diet like Oprah’s. I think this could be one I could actually follow! What do you think?
