It only takes a few seconds on a search engine to prove that there is A LOT of information about diets out there.

While it’s really nice to have access to so much information, it can be a teeny bit overwhelming trying to decide which tips to follow. And then there’s that little matter of those tips being on the internet… where, ya know, not everyone tells the truth? Between the mass amount of choices, the ads promising to melt off 50 pounds in two days, and the….lets call them “misinformed people”, it can be really hard to shed those few extra holiday pounds or kick start a new healthy lifestyle. The only real way to know what’s true and what will work for you is to do hours upon hours researching every diet tip known to man… sounds fun, right??? NO???

Here’s where I come in….

Lucky for you, I AM A GIANT NERD. And I happen to really, really like researching nutrition and diet stuff. I mean, it is my future career after all.
Like you, I find the crazy amount of diet information exhausting, and I really want one singular place where I can go and compare all the different diets, AND be sure I’m not just reading an advertisement. As far as I know, such a place does not exist….until now, that is!

Join me as I attempt to make sense of all the diet stuffs out there. From Mediterranean to Ketogenic, I plan to explore it all!

Got any diets you want more information about? Drop a comment and that diet may just be the topic of my next post!
